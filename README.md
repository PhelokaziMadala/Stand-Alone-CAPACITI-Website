# Stand-Alone-CAPACITI-Website
The CAPACITI Website Redesign Project aims to deliver a modern, engaging, and user-centric digital platform that accurately reflects the organisation’s mission, values, and impact. Designed with accessibility, scalability, and performance in mind, this project focuses on elevating the user experience for a diverse audience—including prospective candidates, partners, funders, employers, and the general public.

The redesigned site will feature a clean and intuitive layout, enhanced visual storytelling, and simplified navigation to make CAPACITI’s programmes, success stories, and partnership opportunities easily discoverable. Key sections will include: About, Programmes, Impact, News & Events, Blog, and Opportunities—with dynamic elements such as data visualizations, testimonials, filterable content, and interactive forms.

Core features will include:

Photo and key information display on the homepage to quickly introduce visitors to CAPACITI’s purpose and highlights.

A “Learn More” video embedded in the hero section to provide deeper insight into the organisation’s work.

A contact form powered by Formspree, allowing users to easily send inquiries or messages.

Supabase integration for backend handling of applications, ensuring secure and real-time database management.

Google Maps integration to display CAPACITI’s physical office location, helping visitors easily find and connect with the organisation.

A responsive layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for seamless use across all devices.

This redesign will serve as a strategic communication and engagement tool, strengthening CAPACITI’s online presence and supporting its mission to connect talent with opportunity through a well-crafted digital experience.
